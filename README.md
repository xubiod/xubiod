## what
i mainly use the following for personal projects (open/semi-open/closed):

- **gdscript** in **godot engine**
- **c#** with **.net 6** in visual studio 2022
  - have worked with c# since .net framework 4.x, more comfortable with .net core and beyond

for education reasons (college) i have worked with:

- **java** for a few trimesters
  - working in **intellij**
- **python 3** for one trimester
  - working in **visual studio**
- **c** for a few trimesters
  - linux-based oses only, using `gcc` and `gdb`

  - both in `vim` and vscode using remote-ssh
    - *i can close vim but it's a secret shhhhhh*

i have used these in the past:

- **gamemaker language** ranging from **gm:s 1.4.x** to **gms2.3+**
  - most comfortable with later versions with structs and memory management
